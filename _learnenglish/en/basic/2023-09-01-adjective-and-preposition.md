Some adjectives are associated with specific prepositions. Because there are no grammatical rules governing which preposition goes with which adjective, it's a good idea to learn them together. There are, nevertheless, a few patterns that might help you. Let's start with them. Remember that a preposition is always followed by a noun or a gerund (in the <span class="fst-italic">-ing</span> form).

- With *at* <br>
[**Adjective**] + *at* + [**skills or abilities**] <br>
Example:
    - I'm **good** *at* **math**.
    - He's **bad** *at* **drawing**.
    - They're **terrible** *at* **music**.
- With *about* <br>
[**Adjective**] + *about* + [**cause of adjective or feeling**] <br>
Example:
    - I'm excited *about* the new job.
    - Budi is sad *about* the result.
    - Tuti is depressed *about* the accident.
- With *of*, similiar to with about (possessive quality) <br>
[**Adjective**] + *of* + [**cause of adjective or feeling**] <br>
Example:
    - You should be proud *of* your progress.
    - Budi was afraid *of* flying.
    - Budi was shocked *of* having an accident.
- With *to*<br>
We can use to to show the connection between people or things. We can also use to to talk about someone's behaviour towards someone else. <br>
[**Adjective**] + *to* + [**connection**] <br>
Example:
    - You should be **nice** *to* **this dog**.
    - Budi is always **polite** *to* **everyone**.
    - Budi is **allergic** *to* **nuts**.
- With *for* <br>
Example:
    - Exercise is **good** *for* you.
    - Stresses is **bad** *for* you.
    - The town is **famous** *for* it's cheese.
- With *in* <br>
Example:
    - She is **interested** *in* the project.
    - They want someone who is **interested** *in* design.
    - I didn't want to get **involved** *in* the argument.
