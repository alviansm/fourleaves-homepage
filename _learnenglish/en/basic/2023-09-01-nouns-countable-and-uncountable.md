<!-- SECTION #7 -->
- **Nouns** - person, place, animal, thing. **Not** an action, description, or preposition.
- There's to type of nouns: **countable**; **uncountable**.
	- **Tips**: To differentiate, try to put a number before the word.
	- **Notes**: If there's more than one, usually we add *-s/-es* in the word. However, there's some **exceptions** that we don't need to add *-e/-es* for some words such as fish, moose.
- **Countable** - can be quantified. If it's one, put *a/an* in front of the word. If it's more than one, put *-s/-es* instead at the end of the words.
- **Tips**: When you're speaking and not sure if it's countable or not but it's seemingly many, put *a lot of* in front of the word, instead of many, much, some, any, etc. **Many is for countable**, whereas **much is for uncountable**.
