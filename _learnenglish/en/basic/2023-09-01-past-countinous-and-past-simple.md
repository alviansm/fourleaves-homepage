<!-- SECTION #8 -->
- **Past simple**
    The past simple shows us that an action was in the **past**, **not** in the **present**. **Regular** past simple verbs have *-ed* at the end (e.g. called, played, arrived). **Irregular** verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. wake → woke, break → broke, feel → felt).
    - **Positive**
        - My parents called me yesterday.
        - I woke up early this morning.
        - Sam played basketball when he was at university.
    - **Negative**
        We make the negative with *didn't* and *the infinitive verb*.
        - My parents didn't call me yesterday.
        - I didn't wake up early this morning.
    - **Question**
        We make the question form with *did* and then *the subject* and *infinitive verb*.
        - **Did you wake up** early this morning?
        - **Did Sam play basketball** when he was at university?
- **Past Continous**
  The past continuous shows us that the action was **already in progress at a certain time in the past**. The past continuous can also show that an activity was **in progress for some time, not just for a moment**. We make the past continuous with *was* or *were* and the *-ing* form of the verb.
	- Positive
		- What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night? I was studying. (This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.)
		- We were cleaning the house all morning. (This means that at some day, we were cleaning the house for some time.)
		- She couldn't come to the party. She was working.
		- Three years ago, we were living in my home town.
		- I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn't listening.
		- What were you doing this time last year?
- **Past continous and past simple**
  When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the past simple action happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress.	
	- While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy. <br>	
  We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.
	- I broke my leg when I was skiing.
	- As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.
	- We were watching television when the power went off.
	  See the difference!
	- When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner. (When the guests arrive, Jane is cooking dinner)
	- When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner. (Interruption -> The guest arrive first, then jane start to cook dinner)
