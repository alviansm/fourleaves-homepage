We use
[i/you/we/they] + [have got or he/she/it] + [has got]
to talk about things that we have.
Table below shows which are the first, second, and third person pronouns.

- In many situations, have and have got mean the same thing. Have got is a little less formal than have. We often use have got more in speaking and have more in writing.
- We can use have/has got to talk about appearance, family and friends or possessions. We often contract the verb, especially when we're speaking.
- We can also use have/has got for timetabled events, illnesses or abstract things.
