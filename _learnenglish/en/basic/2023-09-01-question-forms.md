<!-- SECTION #16 -->
# <span id="16"></span>

To make questions, we often put the verb before the subject. This is called inversion.
- Affirmative
  [subject] + [verb (to be)]
	- I am late.
	- I can help.
	- She is sleeping.
If there is a question word (why, what, where, how, etc.), it goes before the verb.
- Question
  [question word] + [verb] + [subject]
	- Am I late?
	- Can I help?
	- Is she sleeping?

## Exception
In some questions, who or what is the subject of the verb. There is no inversion of subject and verb in these questions.
- Who broke the window?
- Who is asking?
