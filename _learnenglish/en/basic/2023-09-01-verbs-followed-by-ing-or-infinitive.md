<!-- SECTION #18 -->
A verb can be followed by another verb. The second one usually needs to change into the -ing form or the to + infinitive form. Which form you need depends on what the first verb is.
- -ing
  When enjoy, admit and mind are followed by another verb, it must be in the -ing form.
	- I enjoy travelling.
	- He admitted stealing the necklace.
	- I don't mind waiting if you're busy.
- [to] + [infinitive]
  When want, learn and offer are followed by another verb, it must be in the to + infinitive form.
	- I want to speak to the manager.
	- She's learning to play the piano.
	- He offered to help us wash up.
