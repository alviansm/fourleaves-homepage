# <span id="2009">2009 - the story behind</span>

It was in 2009, when my parents bought my big brother and I a new personal computer. At that time, android smartphone is'nt popular yet. Remembering those time is quite nostalqic for me. Majority of kids' time is still spent in farms and fields, including me. Everythings about them is playing around and curiosity.

I remember very well that when the computer is arrived in our house, I'm fishing a catfish in a pool in my village. It was in a day in a Ramadhan month. When we're tired enough of the schorching sun, problably around 4 p.m., I started to gome home, with a new pc already in it. I think at that day, for the first time I'm tinkering with a personal computer, playing Feeding Frenzy to wait for the feast (Ngabuburit). Though my brother and I were already familiar with technology such as PC and video game consoles, we're still not too excited because we didn't know what it's capable yet. Especially for me, I'm sitting around in front of the pc's desk when no kids is'nt playing around in the village. Still, playing in fields around in the village is a thing that filled my mind at the time.

Perhaps, it was around 2011 when we have access to internet with a smartfren modem when I started to more fascinated about technology. I started to browsing around in the internet, finding things out, especially about dinosaurs, future technology, and softwares. Social media is'nt a thing yet at the time, even I remember I only used them such as Facebook to check my internet connection by messaging random people or writing/uploading some random status, because the internet connection was very slow and frustating for us.

I don't remember exactly when we're started to curious about how to make a video games, but I remember my big brother bought a new book about making video games using flash player at some point (we still have the book). It was an entertaining and insightful book. However, at that time I thought the game that we develop wasn't quiet dynamic yet. So, I'm searching for a programs that capable of developing games. It was the first time I recognize that softwares that used to develop a video game is called game engine. Later, I found a game engine called Game Maker by yoyogames, at a website called cnet.

Fascinating for cnet and game maker to both of them still exists now, with a huge improvements of course, because I remember many websites recede then gone, including an Indonesian social network website, called Indogoo. It was at thit website, we're uploading games that we develop. It's quiet sad because it was the first time when we're receiving feedbacks from people. Our games is a hot topic in that forum I recall.

Later on, when our hardware isn't capable of following the software improvements that when we stop developing video games. When pandemic occur and I had to go back to my home in the village, sometimes I'm recalling the old time and started to find if our in the old pc is still exist. Tough the pc is completely broken, it is quiet fortunate for me that the harddisk is still functional. I bought a connector cable for it, and started to look up some old files in the pc.

Actually, there's a lot more video games that we develop, but sadly that's the only one that I could save from the old pc's harddisk. Meteorit and Trash Bomb as I recall is completed by my big brother, as the graphics and game mechanics is mostly okay. The incredibly weird one, is mostly by me.

Trash bomb is a single-player video game to prevent bombs dropped from airplanes into an area on each level, by clicking the bombs and bounce it into the trashbin, with new challenges on each levels.

## EOTL

End of the Life is one of the very first games that we develop. It's an adventure platformer game with dozens of levels that don't make sense. Sometimes, it's just almost impossible to accomplish the level. Additionally, two players could play together on the same PC. Correct, it is a typical old video game multiplayer type, not an online multiplayer game like nowadays.
