Hi, my name is Alviansyah Maulana Iskandar - people call me Alvians - and this is my website.

As per creating this website, I've finished my journey as a marine engineering undergraduate student. The 4 years I've spent, perhaps, are the self reflection process regarding how I perceive the world and myself. I'd like to rewrite what I've learned from that journey to refresh my understanding of various engineering topics. However, there's one topic that I'd really like to discuss: electric circuits. With that knowledge, I wish I could really contribute more to increasing the equitable prosperity of people around the world. I love open sources and am planning to initiate some open source software and libraries in engineering and the digitalization of small businesses.
